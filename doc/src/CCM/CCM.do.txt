========= The Coupled-Cluster Method =========


======= Introduction =======

The coupled-cluster method is an efficient tool to compute atomic
nuclei with an effort that grows polynomial with system size. While
this might still be expensive, it is now possible to compute nuclei
with mass numbers about $A\approx 100$ with this method. Recall that
full configuration interaction (FCI) such as the no-core shell model
exhibits an exponential cost and is therefore limited to light nuclei.

FIGURE: [figslides/Explosion.png, width=600 frac=0.8] Realistic computations of atomic nuclei with interactions from chiral EFT. The slow increase prior to 2015 is based on quantum Monte Carlo and the no-core shell model. These methods are exponentially expensive (in mass number $A$) and meet with exponentially increasing computer power (Moore's law), thus leading to a progress that is linear in time. Methods such as coupled clusters and in-medium SRG carry a polynomial cost in mass number are transforming the field. label{fig-explosion}


======= The normal-ordered Hamiltonian =======

We start from the reference state

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{HFref}
|\Phi_0\rangle = \prod_{i=1}^A a^\dagger_i |0\rangle 
\end{equation}
!et

for the description of a nucleus with mass number $A$.  Usually, this
reference is the Hartree-Fock state, but that is not necessary. In the
shell-model picture, it could also be a product state where the lowest
$A$ harmonic oscillator states are occupied.  Here and in what
follows, the indices $i,j,k,\ldots$ run over hole states,
i.e. orbitals occupied in the reference state (ref{HFref}), while
$a,b,c,\ldots$ run over particle states, i.e. unoccupied
orbitals. Indices $p,q,r,s$ can identify any orbital.  Let $n_u$ be
the number of unoccupied states, and $A$ is of course the number of
occupied states. We consider the Hamiltonian

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Ham} H =
\sum_{pq} \varepsilon^p_q a^\dagger_p a_q +
\frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs}\langle pq|V|rs\rangle
a^\dagger_pa^\dagger_q a_sa_r
\end{equation}
!et



The reference state (ref{HFref}) is a non-trivial vacuum of our theory. 
We normal order this Hamiltonian with respect to the nontrivial vacuum
state given by the Hartree-Fock reference and obtain the
normal-ordered Hamiltonian

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{HN}
H_N = \sum_{pq} f_{pq} \left\{a^\dagger_p a_q\right\} + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs}\langle pq|V|rs\rangle \left\{a^\dagger_pa^\dagger_q a_sa_r\right\}.
\end{equation}
!et

Here,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Fock}
f^p_q = \varepsilon^p_q + \sum_i \langle pi|V|qi\rangle
\end{equation}
!et

is the Fock matrix. We note that the Fock matrix is diagonal in the
Hartree-Fock basis. The brackets $\{\cdots\}$ in Eq. (ref{HN}) denote
normal ordering, i.e. all operators that annihilate the nontrivial
vaccum (ref{HFref}) are to the right of those operators that create
with respect to that vaccum. Normal ordering implies that $\langle
\Phi_0|H_N|\Phi_0\rangle = 0$.

!bblock
===== Exercise: Practice in normal ordering =====

Normal order the expression $\sum\limits_{pq}\varepsilon_q^p a^\dagger_p a_q$.

!bhint
!bt
\begin{align}
\sum_{pq}\varepsilon_q^p a^\dagger_p a_q
=\sum_{ab}\varepsilon_b^a a^\dagger_a a_b
+\sum_{ai}\varepsilon_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i
+\sum_{ai}\varepsilon_a^i a^\dagger_i a_a   
+\sum_{ij}\varepsilon_j^i a^\dagger_i a_j
\end{align}
!et
!ehint

!bans
We have to move all operators that annihilate the reference state to the right of those that create on the reference state. Thus,
!bt
\begin{align}
\sum_{pq}\varepsilon_q^p a^\dagger_p a_q
&=\sum_{ab}\varepsilon_b^a a^\dagger_a a_b
+\sum_{ai}\varepsilon_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i
+\sum_{ai}\varepsilon_a^i a^\dagger_i a_a
+\sum_{ij}\varepsilon_j^i a^\dagger_i a_j\\
&=\sum_{ab}\varepsilon_b^a a^\dagger_a a_b
+\sum_{ai}\varepsilon_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i
+\sum_{ai}\varepsilon_a^i a^\dagger_i a_a
+\sum_{ij}\varepsilon_j^i \left(-a_ja^\dagger_i +\delta_i^j\right)\\
&=\sum_{ab}\varepsilon_b^a a^\dagger_a a_b
+\sum_{ai}\varepsilon_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i
+\sum_{ai}\varepsilon_a^i a^\dagger_i a_a
-\sum_{ij}\varepsilon_j^i a_ja^\dagger_i +\sum_i \varepsilon_i^i\\
&=\sum_{pq}\varepsilon_q^p \left\{a^\dagger_p a_q\right\} +\sum_i \varepsilon_i^i
\end{align}
!et

We note that $H = E_{HF} + H_N$, where

!bt
\begin{align}
E_{HF} &\equiv \langle\Phi_0|H|\Phi_0\rangle = \sum_{i} \varepsilon^i_i +\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}\langle ij|V|ij\rangle
\end{align}
!et

is the Hartree-Fock energy.



The coupled-cluster method is a very efficient tool to compute nuclei
when a ``good'' reference state is available. Let us assume that the
reference state results from a Hartree-Fock calculation.

!bblock
===== Exercise: What does ``good'' mean? =====

How do you know whether a Hartree-Fock state is a ``good'' reference?
Which results of the Hartee-Fock computation will inform you?

!bans

Once the Hartree-Fock equations are solved, the Fock matrix
(ref{Fock}) becomes diagonal, and its diagonal elements can be viewed
as single-particle energies. Hopefully, there is a clear gap in the
single-particle spectrum at the Fermi surface, i.e. after $A$ orbitals
are filled.

!eans
===== =====
!eblock

If symmetry-restricted Hartree-Fock is used, one is limited to compute
nuclei with closed subshells for neutrons and for protons. On a first
view, this might seem as a severe limitation. But is it? 

!bblock
===== Exercise: How many nuclei are accessible with the coupled cluster method based on spherical mean fields? =====

If one limits oneself to nuclei with mass number up to
mass number $A=60$, how many nuclei can potentially be described with
the coupled-cluster method? Which of these nuclei are potentially
interesting? Why?

!bans

Nuclear shell closures are at $N,Z=2,8,20,28,50,82,126$, and subshell
closures at $N,Z=2,6,8,14,16,20,28,32,34,40,50,\ldots$. 

In the physics of nuclei, the evolution of nuclear structure as
neutrons are added (or removed) from an isotope is a key
interest. Examples are the rare isotopes of helium ($^{8,10}$ He) 
oxygen ($^{22,24,28}$ O), calcium ($^{52,54,60}$ Ca), nickel ($^{78}$ Ni)
and tin ($^{100,132}$ Sn). The coupled-cluster method has the potential
to address questions regarding these nuclei, and in a several cases
was used to make predictions before experimental data was
available. In addition, the method can be used to compute neighbors of
nuclei with closed subshells.

======= The similarity-transformed Hamiltonian =======


There are several ways to view and understand the coupled-cluster
method. A first simple view of coupled-cluster theory is that the
method induces correlations into the reference state by expressing a
correlated state as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{psi}
|\Psi\rangle = e^T|\Phi_0\rangle ,
\end{equation}
!et

Here, $T$ is an operator that induces correlations. We can now demand
that the correlate state (ref{psi}) becomes and eigenstate of the
Hamiltonian $H_N$, i.e.  $H_N|\Psi\rangle = E|\Psi\rangle$. This view,
while correct, is not the most productive one.  Instead, we
left-multiply the Schroedinger equation with $e^{-T}$ and find

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Schroedinger}
\overline{H_N}|\Phi_0\rangle = E_c |\Phi_0\rangle . 
\end{equation}
!et

Here, $E_c$ is the correlation energy, and the total energy is
$E=E_c+E_{HF}$.  The similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is defined as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Hsim}
\overline{H_N} \equiv e^{-T} H_N e^T .
\end{equation}
!et


A more productive view on coupled-cluster theory thus emerges: This
method seeks a similarity transformation such that the uncorrelated
reference state (ref{HFref}) becomes an exact eigenstate of the
similarity-transformed Hamiltonian (ref{Hsim}).

!bblock
===== Exercise: What $T$ leads to Hermitian $\overline{H_N}$ ? =====

What are the conditions on $T$ such that $\overline{H_N}$ is Hermitian?

!bans

For a Hermitian $\overline{H_N}$, we need a unitary $e^T$, i.e. an anti-Hermitian $T$ with
$T = -T^\dagger$

!eans
===== =====
!eblock

As we will see below, coupld-cluster theory employs a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

!bblock
===== Exercise: Understanding (non-unitary) similarity transformations =====

Show that $\overline{H_N}$ has the same eigenvalues as $H_N$ for
arbitrary $T$. What is the spectral decomposition of a non-Hermitian
$\overline{H_N}$ ?

!bans

Let $H_N|E\rangle = E|E\rangle$. Thus

!bt
\begin{align*}
H_N e^{T} e^{-T} |E\rangle &= E|E\rangle , \\
\left(e^{-T} H_N e^T\right) e^{-T} |E\rangle &= Ee^{-T} |E\rangle , \\
\overline{H_N} e^{-T} |E\rangle &= E e^{-T}|E\rangle .
\end{align*}
!et

Thus, if $|E\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $H_N$ with eigenvalue $E$,
then $e^{-T}|E\rangle$ is eigenstate of $\overline{H_N}$ with the same
eigenvalue.

A non-Hermitian $\overline{H_N}$ has eigenvalues $E_\alpha$
corresponding to left $\langle L_\alpha|$ and right $|R_\alpha
\rangle$ eigenstates. Thus

!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H_N} = \sum_\alpha |R_\alpha\rangle E_\alpha \langle L_\alpha |
\end{align}
!et
with bi-orthonormal $\langle L_\alpha|R_\beta\rangle = \delta_\alpha^\beta$. 

!eans
===== =====
!eblock


To make progress, we have to specify the cluster operator $T$. In
coupled cluster theory, this operator is

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Top}
T \equiv \sum_{ia} t_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijab}t_{ij}^{ab}
a^\dagger_aa^\dagger_ba_ja_i + \cdots
+ \frac{1}{(A!)^2}\sum_{i_1\ldots i_A a_1 \ldots a_A}
t_{i_1\ldots i_A}^{a_1\ldots a_A} a^\dagger_{a_1}\cdots a^\dagger_{a_A} a_{i_A}\cdots a_{i_1} .
\end{equation}
!et


Thus, the operator (ref{Top}) induces particle-hole (p-h)
excitations with respect to the reference. In general, $T$ generates
up to $Ap-Ah$ excitations, and the unknown parameters are the cluster amplitides
$t_i^a$, $t_{ij}^{ab}$, ..., $t_{i_1,\ldots,i_A}^{a_1,\ldots,a_A}$.

!bblock
===== Exercise: How many unknowns? =====

Show that the number of unknowns is as large as the FCI dimension of
the problem, using the numbers $A$ and $n_u$.

!bans

We have to sum up all $np-nh$ excitations, and there are
$\binom{n_u}{n}$ particle states and $\binom{A}{A-n}$ hole states for
each $n$. Thus, we have for the total number

!bt
\begin{align}
\sum_{n=0}^A \binom{n_u}{n} \binom{A}{A-n}= \binom{A+n_u}{A} .
\end{align}
!et

The right hand side are obviously all ways to distribute $A$ fermions over $n_0+A$ orbitals.
!eans
===== =====
!eblock


Thus, the coupled-cluster method with the full cluster operator
(ref{Top}) is exponentially expensive, just as FCI. To make progress,
we need to make an approximation by truncating the operator. Here, we
will use the CCSD (coupled clusters singles doubles) approximation,
where

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Tccsd}
T \equiv \sum_{ia} t_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijab}t_{ij}^{ab}
a^\dagger_aa^\dagger_ba_ja_i .
\end{equation}
!et

We need to dermine the unknown cluster amplitudes that enter in CCSD. Let

!bt
\begin{align}
|\Phi_i^a\rangle &= a^\dagger_a a_i |\Phi_0\rangle , \\
|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle &= a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_j a_i |\Phi_0\rangle
\end{align}
!et

be 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations of the reference. Computing matrix
elements of the Schroedinger Equation (ref{Schroedinger}) yields

!bt
\begin{align}
\label{ccsd}
\langle \Phi_0|\overline{H_N}|\Phi_0\rangle &= E_c , \\
\langle \Phi_i^a|\overline{H_N}|\Phi_0\rangle &= 0 , \\
\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab}|\overline{H_N}|\Phi_0\rangle &= 0 .
\end{align}
!et

The first equation states that the coupled-cluster correlation energy
is an expectation value of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. The
second and third equations state that the similarity-transformed
Hamiltonian exhibits no 1p-1h and no 2p-2h excitations. These
equations have to be solved to find the unknown amplitudes $t_i^a$ and
$t_{ij}^{ab}$. Then one can use these amplitudes and compute the
correlation energy from the first line of Eq. (ref{ccsd}).

We note that in the CCSD approximation the reference state is not an
exact eigenstates. Rather, it is decoupled from simple states but
$\overline{H}$ still connects this state to 3p-3h, and 4p-4h states
etc.

At this point, it is important to recall that we assumed starting from
a ``good'' reference state. In such a case, we might reasonably expect
that the inclusion of 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations could result in an
accurate approximation. Indeed, empirically one finds that CCSD
accounts for about 90% of the corelation energy, i.e. of the
difference between the exact energy and the Hartree-Fock energy. The
inclusion of triples (3p-3h excitations) typically yields 99% of the
correlation energy.

We see that the coupled-cluster method in its CCSD approximation
yields a similarity-transformed Hamiltonian that is of a two-body
structure with respect to a non-trivial vacuum. When viewed in this
light, the coupled-cluster method ``transforms'' an $A$-body problem
(in CCSD) into a two-body problem, albeit with respect to a nontrivial
vacuum.


======= Computing the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian =======

The solution of the CCSD equations, i.e. the second and third line of
Eq. (ref{ccsd}), and the computation of the correlation energy
requires us to compute matrix elements of the similarity-transformed
Hamiltonian (ref{Hsim}). This can be done with the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion

!bt
\begin{align}
\label{BCH}
\overline{H_N} &= e^{-T} H_N e^T \\
&=H_N + \left[ H_N, T\right]+ \frac{1}{2!}\left[ \left[ H_N, T\right], T\right]
+ \frac{1}{3!}\left[\left[ \left[ H_N, T\right], T\right], T\right] +\ldots .
\end{align}
!et

We now come to a key element of coupled-cluster theory: the cluster
operator (ref{Top}) consists of sums of terms that consist of particle
creation and hole annihilation operators (but no particle annihilation
or hole creation operators). Thus, all terms that enter $T$ commute
with each other. This means that the commutators in the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion (ref{BCH}) can only be non-zero
because each $T$ must connect to $H_N$ (but no $T$ with another
$T$). Thus, the expansion is finite.

!bblock
===== Exercise: When does CCSD truncate? =====

In CCSD and for two-body Hamiltonians, how many nested
commutators yield nonzero results? Where does the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion terminate? What is the (many-body) rank of the resulting $\overline{H_N}$? 

!bans

CCSD truncates for two-body operators at four-fold nested commutators,
because each of the four annihilation and creation operators in
$\overline{H_N}$ can be knocked out with one term of $T$.

!eans
===== =====
!eblock


We see that the (disadvantage of having a) non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
$\overline{H_N}$ leads to the advantage that the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is finite, thus leading to the
possibility to compute $\overline{H_N}$ exactly. In contrast, the
IMSRG deals with a Hermitian Hamiltonian throughout, and the infinite
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is truncated at a high order when
terms become very small.

We write the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian as

!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H_N}=\sum_{pq} \overline{H}^p_q a^\dagger_q a_p + {1\over 4} \sum_{pqrs} \overline{H}^{pq}_{rs} a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a_s a_r + \ldots
\end{align}
!et
with
!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H}^p_q &\equiv \langle p|\overline{H_N}|q\rangle , \\
\overline{H}^{pq}_{rs} &\equiv \langle pq|\overline{H_N}|rs\rangle .
\end{align}
!et

Thus, the CCSD Eqs.~(ref{ccsd}) for the amplitudes can be written as
$\overline{H}_i^a = 0$ and $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}=0$.

!bblock
===== Exercise: Compute the matrix element $\overline{H}_{ab}^{ij}\equiv \langle ij|\overline{H_N}|ab\rangle$ =====



!bans

This is a simple task. This matrix element is part of the operator
$\overline{H}_{ab}^{ij}a^\dagger_ia^\dagger_ja_ba_a$, i.e. particles
are annihilated and holes are created. Thus, no contraction of the
Hamiltonian $H$ with any cluster operator $T$ (remember that $T$
annihilates holes and creates particles) can happen, and we simply
have $\overline{H}_{ab}^{ij} = \langle ij|V|ab\rangle$.

!eans
===== =====
!eblock


We need to work out the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian of
Eq. (ref{BCH}). To do this, we write $T=T_1 +T_2$ and $H_N= F +V$,
where $T_1$ and $F$ are one-body operators, and $T_2$ and $V$ are
two-body operators.

!bblock
===== Example: The contribution of $[F, T_2]$ to $\overline{H_N}$ =====

The commutator $[F, T_2]$ consists of two-body and one-body terms. Let
us compute first the two-body term, as it results from a single
contraction (i.e. a single application of $[a_p, a^\dagger_q] =
\delta_p^q$). We denote this as $[F, T_2]_{2b}$ and find

!bt
\begin{align*}
[F, T_2]_{2b} &= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{rsuv} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\left[a^\dagger_q a_p, a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_j a_i \right]_{2b} \\
&= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{abij} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\delta_p^a a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{abij} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\delta_p^b a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_a a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{abij} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\delta_q^j a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i  \\
&+ \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{abij} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\delta_q^i a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_j  \\
&= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{qbij}\left(\sum_{a} f_a^q t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{qaij}\left(\sum_{b} f_b^q t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_a a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pabi}\left(\sum_{j} f_p^j t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i  \\
&+ \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pabj}\left(\sum_{i} f_p^i t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_j  \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{qbij}\left(\sum_{a} f_a^q t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{2}\sum_{pabi}\left(\sum_{j} f_p^j t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i  .
\end{align*}
!et

Here we exploited the antisymmetry $t_{ij}^{ab} = -t_{ji}^{ab} =
-t_{ij}^{ba} = t_{ji}^{ba}$ in the last step. Using $a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i = -a^\dagger_b a^\dagger_q a_j a_i $ and $a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i = a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_i a_p$, we can make the expression 
manifest antisymmetric, i.e.
!bt
\begin{align*}
[F, T_2]_{2b}
&= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{qbij}\left[\sum_{a} \left(f_a^q t_{ij}^{ab}-f_a^b t_{ij}^{qa}\right)\right]a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pabi}\left[\sum_{j} \left(f_p^j t_{ij}^{ab}-f_i^j t_{pj}^{ab}\right)\right]a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i  .
\end{align*}
!et
Thus, the contribution of $[F, T_2]_{2b}$ to the matrix element $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}$ is  
!bt
\begin{align*}
\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab} \leftarrow  \sum_{c} \left(f_c^a t_{ij}^{cb}-f_c^b t_{ij}^{ac}\right) - \sum_{k} \left(f_j^k t_{ik}^{ab}-f_i^k t_{jk}^{ab}\right)
\end{align*}
!et

Here we used an arrow to indicate that this is just one contribution
to this matrix element.  We see that the derivation straight forward,
but somewhat tedious. As no one likes to commute too much (neither in
this example nor when going to and from work), and so we need a better
approach. This is where diagramms come in handy.

by noting that the following diagrams of the inetraction are all

Finally, we have the following diagrams for the $T_1$ and $T_2$ amplitudes.
FIGURE: [figslides/Diagrams-T.png, width=800 frac=0.8] The horizontal full line is the cluster amplitude with incoming hole lines and outgoing particle lines as indicated. label{fig-T}

We are now in the position to construct the diagrams of the
similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, keeping in mind that these
diagrams correspond to matrix elements of $\overline{H_N}$. The rules
are as follows.

o Write down all *topologically different* diagrams corresponding to the desired matrix element. Topologically different diagrams differ in the number and type of lines (particle or hole) that connect the Fock matrix $F$ or the interaction $V$ to the cluster amplitudes $T$, but not whether these connections are left or right (as those are related by antisymmetry). As an example, all diagrams in Fig. ref{fig-symmetry} are topologically identical, because they consist of incoming particle and hole lines and of outgoing particle and hole lines. 

o Write down the matrix elements that enter the diagram, and sum over all internal lines. 

o The overall sign is $(-1)$ to the power of [(number of hole lines) -- (number of loops)].

o Symmetry factor: For each pair of equivalent lines (i.e. lines that connect the same two operators) multiply with a factor $1/2$. For $n$ identical vertices, multiply the algebraic expression by the symmery factor $1/n!$ to account properly for the number of ways the diagram can be constructed.   

o Antisymmetrize the outgoing and incoming lines as necessary.

Please note that this really works. You could derive these rules for
yourself from the commutations and factors that enter the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. The sign comes obviously from the
arrangement of creation and annilhilation operators, while the
symmetry factor stems from all the different ways, one can contract
the cluster operator with the normal-ordered Hamiltonian.

===== Example: CCSD correlation energy =====

The CCSD correlation energy, $E_c= \langle
\Phi_0|\overline{H_N}|\Phi_0\rangle$, is the first of the CCSD
equations (ref{ccsd}). It is a vacuum expectation value and thus
consists of all diagrams with no external legs. There are three such diagrams:

FIGURE: [figslides/Diagrams-E0.png, width=800 frac=0.8] Three diagrams enter for the CCSD correlation energy, i.e. all diagrams that leave no external legs. label{fig-E0}

The correponding algebraic expression is $E_c=\sum_{ia}f^i_a t_i^a +{1\over 4}\sum_{ijab} \langle ij|V|ab\rangle t_{ij}^{ab} + {1\over 2} \sum_{ijab} \langle ij|V|ab\rangle t_i^a t_j^b$.

The first algebraic expression is clear. We have one hole line and one
loop, giving it a positive sign. There are no equivalent lines or
vertices, giving it no symmetry factor. The second diagram has two
loops and two hole lines, again leading to a positive sign. We have a
pair of equivalent hole lines and a pair of equivalent particle lines,
each giving a symmetry factor of $1/2$. The third diagram has two
loops and two hole lines, again leading to a positive sign. We have
two indentical vertices (each connecting to a $T_1$ in the same way)
and thus a symmetry factor $1/2$.

======= CCD Approximation =======

In what follows, we will consider the coupled cluster doubles (CCD)
approximation. This approximation is valid in cases where the system
cannot exhibit any particle-hole excitations (such as nuclear matter
when formulated on a momentum-space grid) or for the pairing model (as
the pairing interactions only excites pairs of particles). In this
case $t_i^a=0$ for all $i, a$, and $\overline{H}_i^a=0$. The CCD
approximation is also of some sort of leading order approximation in
the Hartree-Fock basis (as the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian exhibits no
particle-hole excitations).

===== Exercise: Derive the CCD equations! =====

Let us consider the matrix element $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}$. Clearly,
it consists of all diagrams (i.e. all combinations of $T_2$, and a

Let us now turn to the computational cost of a CCD computation.

!bblock
===== Exercise: Computational scaling of CCD =====

For each of the diagrams in Fig. ref{fig-ccd} write down the
computational cost in terms of the number of occupied $A$ and the
number of unoccupied $n_u$ orbitals.

!bans
The cost is $A^2 n_u^2$, $A^2 n_u^3$, $A^3 n_u^2$,
$A^2 n_u^4$, $A^4 n_u^2$, $A^3 n_u^3$,
$A^4 n_u^4$, $A^4 n_u^4$,
$A^4 n_u^4$, and $A^4 n_u^4$ for the respective diagrams.
!eans
===== =====
!eblock

Note that $n_u\gg A$ in general. In textbooks, one reads that CCD (and
CCSD) cost only $A^2n_u^4$. Our most expensive diagrams, however are
$A^4n_u^4$. What is going on?

To understand this puzzle, let us consider the last diagram of
Fig. ref{fig-ccd}. We break up the computation into two steps,
computing first the intermediate
!bt
\begin{align}
\chi_{ij}^{kl}\equiv {1\over 2} \sum_{cd} \langle kl|V|cd\rangle t_{ij}^{cd}
\end{align}
!et
at a cost of $A^4n_u^2$, and then 
!bt
\begin{align}
{1\over 2} \sum_{kl} \chi_{ij}^{kl} t_{kl}^{ab}  
\end{align}
!et
at a cost of $A^4n_u^2. This is affordable. The price to pay is the
storage of the intermediate $\chi_{ij}^{kl}$, i.e. we traded
memory for computational cycles. This trick is known as
``factorization.'' 


!bblock
===== Exercise: Factorize the remaining diagrams of the CCD equation =====

Diagrams 7, 8, and 9 of Fig. ref{fig-ccd} also need to be factorized.

{1\over 2} P(ij)P(ab) \sum_{ld} \chi_{id}^{al} t_{lj}^{db} 
\end{align}
!et
at the cost of $A^3 n_u^3$.

For diagram number 8, we compute
!bt
\begin{align}
\chi_{i}^{l}\equiv -{1\over 2} \sum_{kcd} \langle kl|V|cd\rangle t_{ik}^{cd}
\end{align}

===== Solving the CCD equations =====

The CCD equations, depicted in Fig. ref{fig-ccd}, are nonlinear in the
cluster amplitudes. How do we solve $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}=0$? We add
$(f_a^a +f_b^b -f_i^i -f_j^j)t_{ij}^{ab}$ to both sides of
$\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}=0$ and find

!bt
\begin{align*}
(f_a^a +f_b^b -f_i^i -f_j^j)t_{ij}^{ab} &= (f_a^a +f_b^b -f_i^i -f_j^j)t_{ij}^{ab} +\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}
\end{align*}
!et

Dividing by $(f_a^a +f_b^b -f_i^i -f_j^j)$ yields
!bt
\begin{align}
t_{ij}^{ab} &= t_{ij}^{ab} + \frac{\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}}{f_a^a +f_b^b -f_i^i -f_j^j}
\label{iter}
\end{align}
!et

This equation is of the type $t=f(t)$, and we solve it by iteration,
i.e. we start with a guess $t_0$ and iterate $t_{n+1}=f(t_n)$, and
hope that this will converge to a solution. We take the perturbative result
!bt
\begin{align}
\label{pert}
\left(t_{ij}^{ab}\right)_0 = \frac{\langle ab|V|ij\rangle}{f_a^a +f_b^b -f_i^i -f_j^j}
\end{align}
!et

as a starting point, compute $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}$, and find a new
$t_{ij}^{ab}$ from the right-hand side of Eq. (ref{iter}). We repeat
this process until the amplitudes converge.

======= CCD for the pairing Hamiltonian =======

You learned about the pairing Hamiltonian earlier in this
school. Convince yourself that this Hamiltonian does not induce any
1p-1h excitations. Let us solve the CCD equations for this
problem. This consists of the following steps

o Write a function that compute the potential. We need $\langle ab|V|cd\rangle$, $\langle ij|V|kl\rangle$, and $\langle ab|V|ij\rangle$. Why is there no $\langle ab|V|id\rangle$ or $\langle ai|V|jb\rangle$ ?

o Write a function that computes the Fock matrix. We only need $f_a^b$ and $f_i^j$. Why? 

o Initialize the cluster amplitudes according to Eq. (ref{pert}), and solve Eq. (ref{iter}) by iteration.
